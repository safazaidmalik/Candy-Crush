# Candy-Crush
This project is based on the popular game Candy Crush, built using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It aims to provide a simplified version of the game mechanics and user interface.


# Features
1. Grid-based game board: The game consists of a grid-based board where candies are placed in different positions. Players can swap adjacent candies to create matches and clear them from the board.
2. Candy matching: When three or more candies of the same type are aligned horizontally or vertically, they are considered a match and are removed from the board, allowing new candies to fall into place.
3. Score tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number and size of candy matches made. Players can aim to achieve high scores.
4. Level progression: The game includes multiple levels of increasing difficulty. Each level introduces new challenges, such as limited moves or special candies, keeping the gameplay engaging and exciting.
5. Special candies: Certain combinations or matches can create special candies with unique abilities. These special candies can clear multiple candies at once or trigger chain reactions for bonus points.
6. User-friendly interface: The game provides a colorful and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows players to interact with the game board easily.

# How To Play
1. In the terminal, navigate to the "Code" directory, and enter:
make
./game
2. A menu will pop up with options for the player. Press "n" to start a new game.
3. A grid will appear with the player's score on the top. Make diagonal swapping motions across cells in the grid to match alike candies. Matching these candies will gain you points.
